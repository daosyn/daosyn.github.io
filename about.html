My name is Brandon Dao and I am a software developer. I created this site as an outlet for some of my random thoughts that I want to flesh out and share, to no one in particular. I am still in the process of editing a lot of the parts of this site as I figure out whether there is anything else I want to do with it.

During my free time I enjoy reading magical realism novels, listening to post-punk, playing indie games, and working on developing games I will never finish.
