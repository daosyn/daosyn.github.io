<p>Relationships have the potential to be so satiating at times but also draining at others. We tug at each other&rsquo;s emotional chords until they are right on the verge of snapping, and then decide at that moment whether to rip it apart quickly like some sort of adhesive putty or to give it a moment to rest, like a freshly stretched out piece of taffy. They need time to breath and relax, but also conversely if they fail to &ldquo;work out&rdquo; the relationship could just as likely fizzle out. They are so volatile in that one wrong move could mean the end. Relationships are a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>Humans are so flawed. Men develop jealousy and envy while hiding beind a false sense of stoicism. Women have overflowing emotional faucets and need for someone attentive enough to turn them down. Everyone has something to work on, to fix. Everyone wants to fix these things. No one ever gets around to it.</p>
<p>Every direction I look, I see problems with relationships. A co-worker fools around with several women but does not commit to a single one of them, after having spent a year being with a lone girl. A teammate has been funneled in by his culture, parents, and obligation to marry this woman in the States so that he can obtain permanent residency. Someone close to me broke up with her long term boyfriend after finding out he cheated on her. These are things that have happened throughout history, and no one has found a solution to them. It is because relationships are often acted upon by impulse, by a shear desire to find company with another individual.</p>
<p>Dating sucks.</p>
