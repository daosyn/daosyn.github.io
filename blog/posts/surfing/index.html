surfing

<p>&hellip;no, not the act of riding on a rushing wave of water &ndash; the indoor kind, channel surfing. What I had thought was a lost art in the age of Netflix and the Internet has actually never been so prevalent. It has just taken on a different form, with people constantly swiping through apps on their phones, from Instagram to Facebook, from Reddit to Google, from Gmail to Discord, repeat. Even within apps, people find themselves engrossed in switching from the feed to a specific profile or more focused view, and then switching back again. It is hardly a wonder why people seem to have no time to do anything else anymore. Channel surfing is no longer restricted to being on the couch and is now easily accessible by just reaching for one&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
