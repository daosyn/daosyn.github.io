<p>Everyone has inclinations to do things. Everyone has ideas. Ideas are cheap. Ideas are easy to make. Not everyone has the intensity of desire to act upon these ideas and thoughts, however. A person can sit in an office at a corporate job and be ordered to create things on behalf of the company and the person will do them because there is this necessity to do so, because money is a tangible reward and because money is essential to living in society. Once outside the office, it is difficult to continue on personal projects with the same intensity and focus that is required on the job. There is no incentive except for the sense of personal accomplishment. And in order to complete these side projects, one must value this sense of accomplishment more highly than it is actually probably worth. And so it goes.</p>
