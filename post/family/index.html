  <p>I have been feeling quite a bit more sentimental than productive lately, so this is going to be another more personal post that falls outside of the content I had intended to use this blog for.</p>

<p><img src="/image/cousins.png"/>
</p>

<p>The photo above was taken on my second or third visit to England, where my maternal relatives live.
My mom&rsquo;s family had to flee Vietnam during the war, and even though they were separated during their attempt, they were able to eventually reunite in England.
It is a grueling story that my mother has told me and my siblings several times, and as attentive as I have been all of those times I still would be unable to recite every single detail.</p>

<p>My two cousins from my uncle that I call &ldquo;Uncle 7&rdquo; in Vietnamese are smiling on opposite sides while my little sister and I are pictured in the middle.
It was the summer after fifth grade &ndash; or was it sixth grade?
I visited one more time after this, in ninth grade.
I was not able to visit the last time the rest of my family did, as I spent the summer after my Junior year of college taking classes to catch up.</p>

<p>So many things have happened since then, with me and with all of my relatives.
So many things have happened with the rest of the world.
But within the bubble that is my family, my cousin on the left will be finishing his undergrad in music after this year.
My cousin on the right has been recently struggling with anorexia and/or bulimia.
My family is so ignorant to both disorders that we cannot differentiate between the two.
My parents have told me that all of my cousins look up to me and my siblings, I guess because we are the oldest and we have all graduated with decent jobs.
I only hope that I am at least half as interesting as they are.</p>

<p>I think that my grandma may be worried that she is leaving this world soon.
She looks healthy, but her age is showing.
I hope that when I visit her this time it will not be the last time I see her.
I will be there around this time next month.</p>

<p>I have lots of catching up to do.</p>
