  <h1>Overcoming Jealousy</h1>

  <p>I have a problem.
</p>

<p>That problem involves the way that I view others and how I compare myself to them.
In the work place, I compare my level of effort with colleagues that have seniority and feel disheartened knowing that they are getting paid more and are being given more respect, all while being inadequate in newer technologies and best practices.
This is not only an unhealthy thought but completely untrue and inaccurate.
If I have learned anything at all in my quarter century of being alive, it is that experience comes with age.
And yet I cannot currently prevent these thoughts from surfacing every now and then.</p>

<p>More importantly, this same sense of jealousy has crawled its way into my personal life and has severely damaged it.
The only relationship that I have ever had has been slowly poisoned with crippling thoughts of doubt and distrust, and I only have myself to blame.</p>

<p>In a way, these feelings urge me to become a better person so that my close teammates and loved ones have the confidence to depend on me and a reason to stay with me.
But this feeling has snowballed in a personal relationship of mine, growing larger and larger until it finally fell apart from its own weight.
I lashed out and sent thoughtless statements and interrogative words, with nearly baseless accusations to defend the logic behind my self-made theories.
I drove someone I cared deeply about farther away than any physical distance could have separated us from each other.</p>

<p>There is a lesson to be learned here on both fronts, but changing for the better takes a little longer than I would have wished.
I need to respect others more than I already thought I did.
In order to do that, though, I need to first learn how to respect myself.
I have always had a sort of overly humble attitude towards things, thinking that keeping quiet and letting my actions speak for themselves was more important than openly sharing how I feel and what I am thinking about.
It works sometimes, but other times it leads to me coming off as thoughtless and rash.
I do not think it is necessarily bad to feel jealous, but to let it linger and build up has been a mistake.
Jealousy should be expressed openly and calmly, so that it can be melted down to a more reasonable size by the warm truth.
I need to be able to let myself become vulnerable and put more trust into others.</p>

<p>This kind of post had not been something I planned to make on this platform, but this sort of self-reflection has recently been occupying most of my time alone.
I care a lot more about the people in my life than I tend to let on, and I need to change that quality of myself.
Only then will others come to understand how much I care about them.</p>
