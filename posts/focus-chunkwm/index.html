switching terminal focus with chunkwm
</div>
<div id="content">
<p>A quick little trick I solved for recently was switching between multiple iTerm2 windows that I would have open during a normal work day.</p>

<p>My workflow consists of using <code>chunkwm</code> across three different desktops to manage all of my windows without much effort on my part:</p>

<ul>
<li>Desktop 1 (left) is solely for my terminal windows, which are tiled.</li>
<li>Desktop 2 (center) contains my web browser and any other non-IDE tool/app that I may need to use, in monocle format.</li>
<li>Desktop 3 (right) is where I occasionally do some development using an IDE or Visual Studio Code, which is also set to monocle.</li>
</ul>

<p>I prefer to stay in desktops 1 and 2 as much as possible, using <code>vim</code> as often as I can.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">RED=&quot;\[\e[31m\]&quot;
YELLOW=&quot;\[\e[33m\]&quot;
NOCOLOR=&quot;\[\e[00m\]&quot;

PS1=&quot;($((${ITERM_SESSION_ID:1:1}+1))) $RED\u$YELLOW [\W]$NOCOLOR: &quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I opted to not use a hotkey daemon (namely <code>skhd</code>) because I only wanted one specific feature, and that is to be able to easily change focus to different terminal windows.
<code>cmd</code> plus the terminal window number allows me to do that with iTerm2, but the problem was that since I have window bars turned off, I was not able to see the number unless I turned them back on (and for the sake of aesthetics, I chose not to).</p>

<p>So, to solve this I simply output the iTerm2 session ID to my Bash prompt incremented by one (because the ID indexing starts at 0).
It ends up looking something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">(3) daosyn [~]: _
</code></pre>

<p>I can now easily switch to that terminal window without having to guess by pressing <code>cmd+3</code>.</p>
