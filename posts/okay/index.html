<p>I sat there on a park bench facing the river, its current moving at a slow and steady pace.
It was calming.
Birds were chirping off in the distance somewhere, probably by the small pond that formed off of the river a mile south.
The air stood completely still, adding to the calmness.
The green leaves of catalpa trees covered the big, beautiful blue sky.
Rays of sunlight gently eased their way in through the slight openings.
For a split second I thought of the Japanese word that was coined to describe that phenomenon.
I remember having shared that word with my first love.
It was one of the first of many treasured moments that we shared.</p>

<p>The forest of serenity contrasted what I began to feel within myself,
a cacophony of copies of my voice all coming from different directions,
with varying levels of volume and moods and tones and yet still somehow indiscernible from one another.
The foundations holding together the structures of my interior were ruthlessly being torn down by flames of chaos and commotion,
giving way to warm-colored abstract objects that expanded and contracted randomly,
set at their own pace,
responsible for themselves and nothing else.
Rationality simply did not exist in this dimension;
it would come later, the short and fleeting time period of sanity yet to be determined.
In the present, turmoil solely ruled in abundance.</p>

<p>Where was I in all of this?
I looked down at where my abdomen should have been.
There I saw an emptiness, a black hole that wanted to suck me into an endless abyss.
I was drawn to it in such a way that the wall of noise and the destruction around me no longer held any significance.
Pulled into this void with no exit, regret coarsed through my being, not for being thrown into this hole but for the events that led me here.
I surrendered to myself, giving in to the emotions that were attacking me beyond the darkness.
I found myself falling into absurdisms:
that the best action is sometimes inaction,
that this is where I truly belong,
that everything leads to nothing.
I start to fade away, accepting my fate.
I am no longer afraid to die.</p>

<p>I feel a hand touch my shoulder and turn around to see you glancing worriedly at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you okay? I have been telling you about my day but you zoned out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mind blanks immediately, like a television switched off by a kid who was caught watching cartoons outside of his allotted time.
Instead of attempting to explain the inexplicable,
I resign, sparing you from the stress of hearing my incoherent blabber and myself from attempting to relive the memory.
I smile shyly as I utter the words, my face hot from the experience that I had just endured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am okay.&rdquo;</p>
