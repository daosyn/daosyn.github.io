<p>I want to be good at everything but not necessarily the best at everything.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>Being the best at everything is hard work. From just a sheer numbers game, it is almost impossible to become the best at something. And once one becomes the best, the next person in line is always ready to take the spot. It takes a lot of effort to get to the spot, but it takes even more effort to maintain that spot.</p>

<p>I want to put effort in every single thing that I do, so as to not to waste my time and to not waste the time of others. I believe that if I just put the time and effort into something, I can at least get to a point where I am considered &ldquo;good&rdquo; at a certain skill. But I guess my measure of &ldquo;good&rdquo; is askew because people always seem amazed at the small things that I have spent time practicing. It makes me feel validated but it also makes me think about how a lot of people spend a majority of their time doing nothing to improve themselves, or how they are content with doing things poorly because they simply lack an interest in it. In my opinion, everything can be enjoyable. It just takes some time to get to that certain point where it gets exciting and fulfilling.</p>
